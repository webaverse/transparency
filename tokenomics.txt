Webaverse Tokenomics

Goals

- Reward participants first before speculators
Hard to build a community when the main value driver is speculation
Distribute tokens to people who build / create content today

- Incentivize quality
Governance is a content quality bar to maintain project health
Route a large percentage of funds to content development
Have a treasury for promotion

- Be earnest
- Inform the community about what is happening
- No conflicts of interest: only members have a say, no proxy voting

Structure

Webaverse is a Delaware C-Corp, directed by a DAO. The DAO decides what the C-Corp does, and the company follows orders.

Governance Activities

The fungible token FLUX serves as the governance token in the DAO. The powers of the governance token are:
- access to private worlds + weekly governance calls
  - like a secret club
- approve/reject neighborhood proposals for seasons
  - like a zoning officer
- approve/reject first-party nft proposals for seasons
  - like a product scientist
- approve/reject expansion of the team
  - like a board room
- approve/reject changing the token schedule
  - like a town hall
- propose future products / partnerships / business direction / platform features
  - like an ambassador

Season 0 Drop (now)

We will mint 0.1% of the tokens for testing, put into a liquidity pool alongside 1 ETH.

Season 1 Drop (in 10 weeks)

- We work with artists to build out neighborhoods on the Street
- Revenue target 32 ETH from sale of LANDs for S1 
- Exponentially increasing number of plots allocated per season

- We create and sell first-party NFT objects
- Revenue target 10 ETH from sale of 100 NFTs for S1
- A couple of types per season, with exponentially increasing mints

People can decide how much FLUX they want to add to the pool after having atleast 1-2 community calls. Getting estimates from people will help us weigh how much supply / percentages, so we can hedge risk against dilution / slippage / dumps

Token Schedule for Season 1+ (each ~10 weeks)

Code for generating season schedules:

```
const totalFlux = 2 ** 31;

const s1NumParcels = 32;
const parcelsExponent = 0.05;
const parcelPrice = 1;

const s1NumNfts = 100;
const nftsExponent = 0.15;
const nftPrice = 0.1;

let issuedFlux = 0;
let remainingFlux = totalFlux;
let totalParcels = 0;
let totalNfts = 0;
let revenue = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  const flux = Math.floor(remainingFlux * 0.1);
  issuedFlux += flux;
  remainingFlux -= flux;

  const numParcels = Math.floor(s1NumParcels ** (1 + parcelsExponent * (i-1)));
  totalParcels += numParcels;

  const numNfts = Math.floor(s1NumNfts ** (1 + nftsExponent * (i-1)));
  totalNfts += numNfts;

  revenue += (numParcels * parcelPrice) + (numNfts * nftPrice);

  console.log(`Season ${i}: ${flux} FLUX released (${(issuedFlux/totalFlux*100).toFixed(1)}% to date), ${numParcels}/${totalParcels} parcels this season, ${numNfts}/${totalNfts} nfts this season, ${revenue.toFixed(1)} ETH revenue to date`);
}
```

FLUX has a cap of 2^31 = 2147483648, fungible to 18 decimal places.

Each season, 10% of the remaining FLUX is distributed in a Season Drop, resulting in roughly this schedule:
